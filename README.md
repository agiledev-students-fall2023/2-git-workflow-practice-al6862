# [Timeline of Computer History](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/)

This is a website shown to me in my "History of Computing" class in Steinhardt. I thought it was super interesting, especially how some of the events of the timeline are physical counterparts of digital tools, like one guy's collection of all world knowledge to form a search engine. I wonder how the Computer History Museum decided which events were valuable to the timeline, and which events were not. We read a reading that detailed another computing history timeline, and that timeline went even further back to the 19th century.

Wow! This is a very interesting and comprehensive timeline. I personally love history and find it incredibly interesting, especially when there are physical artifacts involved. The history of computing is actually not something I have looked into much, but this definetly has inspired me to go look into it more!
